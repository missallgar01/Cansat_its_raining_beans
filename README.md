# CanSat – Telemetry Analysis Tool

A Python-based telemetry ingestion and analysis tool for processing sensor data from embedded systems projects.

## Overview
This project was developed to support a CanSat-style embedded systems project, focusing on capturing, processing, and analysing telemetry data received via serial communication.

It demonstrates integration between embedded data sources and Python-based analysis tooling.

## Key Features
- Serial communication utilities for incoming telemetry
- Data parsing and structured storage
- Analysis and visualisation of sensor readings
- Lightweight web-based interface for reviewing data

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Serial communication (pyserial)
- Data analysis utilities
- HTML / CSS (basic templates)

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Serial-enabled device (or simulated input)

### Running the Application
```bash
python analysis.py
